    <field name="abstract_teim">'The English Intelligencer' was a small, low budget poetry magazine originally conceived by its editors, Andrew Crozier and Peter Riley to draw together various "avant garde," English poets. The magazine promoted work that was strongly influenced by the work of American contemporaries such as Tom Raworth, Lee Harwood, Jim Burns, and Tom Pickard and was inspired perhaps by Tom Clark's 'Once' series of magazines. The 'English Intelligencer' Archive is a collection of correspondence and manuscripts to, as well as some of 'The English Intelligencer' publications. Collection highlights include manuscripts/letters written by Peter Armstrong, Elaine Feinstein, Barry McSweeney, John Jay, and J. G. Ballard.</field>

The Fales Library is the primary special collections division of the NYU libraries, housing over 170,000 volumes of English and American literature from 1700 to the present. Strengths of the collection include the development of the English and American novel, with an emphasis on the Gothic and the Victorian novel. The Avant Garde Collection comprises printed materials, archives, and other materials related to the avant-garde writing from the 1960s and early 1970s. Curators, including Mel Edestein and Ted Grieder, built the collection during that period. All rights are reserved.</field>

    <field name="bioghist_teim">'The English Intelligencer' appeared 36 times between January 1966 and April 1968-roughly once every three weeks-and was circulated by mailing list to a varying number of English poets. (The fluctuation was between 25 and 65 names.) There was always a hard core of a dozen or so, and these were the poets who gave the magazine its consistency. This intensity of activity was in itself an important fact of English poetry in the 1960s. But, in addition, this hard core of contributor-readers included many of the most active and interesting younger English poets, whose work continued to develop, and who found 'The English Intelligencer' an important contributor to the growth of their poetic consciousness. </field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">'The English Intelligencer' was originally conceived as an attempt to draw together various English poets whose work was thought of as "avant garde," who, for instance, were strongly aware of contemporary American work-these included the poets variously associated with Migrant, the Resuscitator, and Prospect, as well as more isolated individuals such as Tom Raworth, Lee Harwood, Jim Burns, and Tom Pickard-and to provide them with a common meeting point. There was no initial editorial line beyond the selection of poets to circulate the Intelligencer to. The editor, who at the time was associated with the American poet Tom Clark in bringing out the first issue of the Wivenhoe Park Review, felt that such a peculiarly "English" project entailed producing a second magazine of an entirely different character to that of the W.P.R., and the free availability of a mimeograph machine gave him the means to do so. It is likely that the Intelligencer was partly the inspiration for Tom Clark's Once series of magazines: both were produced on the same mimeograph, and they are roughly identical in format.</field>
    <field name="bioghist_teim">The function of the Intelligencer as it had been originally conceived was never realized. The magazine was actually run-down and brought to a halt between December 1967 and April 1968 when it became apparent that a) the size of its readership had become unwieldy, b) it had various levels of readership involvement, and c) those most closely involved felt that the pattern of exchange that had been established had become stultifying.</field>
